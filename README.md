# Manipulation of Venue Data for Performing Artists

## Problem Question
How can I streamline data collection, presentation, and usage in relation to music venues on tours?

### Project Description
This project will allow those managing tours of performing artists to collect, store, and use data that is specific to each tour/venue. It's geared towards performing artists managing their own tours. 

### Project Timeline

#### Jan  (month 0)
* interview
* rewrite criteria
* outline project

#### Feb  (month 1)
* user input (which questions)

#### Mar  (month 2)
* data storing/creation of new form

#### Apr  (month 3)
* tbd

## Criterion A

### Scenario
My client is the working musician who is trying to manage a tour, specifically, venue information. This program is intended for use by musicians themselves, but would also be useful for non-musicians working on the tour (e.g. managers, etc). My advisor for this project would be Tristan Angieri because they have knowledge of both computer science and the music world. I aim to address the issue of unorganized, inefficient information collection, storage, and access in regards to venues on musical tours. Especially for a working musician who must also plan the musical aspects of the tour, coordinating with all parties involved can be overwhelming. I aim to create a system that will allow the user to streamline the information needed for individual tours/venues, gather information in an efficient way, store this information, and supply the information in an accessible way.
