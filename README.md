# Peer Tutoring App

## Problem Question
How can I use technology to improve the efficiency and accessibility of the BFS US Peer Tutoring Program?

### Project Description
The students who use the BFS US Peer Tutoring Program are my clients. There are several aspects of the program that could be more efficient or accessible that I plan to remedy with this app made specifically for this program. Some of the issues I aim to fix include scheduling difficulties, confusion about how/where to apply, finding students for smaller jobs, and updates about sessions. To improve these conditions, I'm designing an app featuring scheduling, notifications, messaging, applications, and position openings.
