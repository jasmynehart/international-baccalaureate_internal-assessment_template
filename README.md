# Manipulation of Venue Data for Performing Artists

## Problem Question
How can I streamline data collection, presentation, and usage in relation to music venues on tours?

### Project Description
This project will allow those managing tours of performing artists to collect, store, and use data that is specific to each tour/venue. It's geared towards performing artists managing their own tours. 

### Project Timeline

#### Jan  (month 0)
* interview
* rewrite criteria
* outline project

#### Feb  (month 1)
* user input (which questions)

#### Mar  (month 2)
* data storing/creation of new form

#### Apr  (month 3)
* tbd

## Criterion A

### Scenario
My client is the working musician who is trying to manage a tour, specifically, venue information. This program is intended for use by musicians themselves, but would also be useful for non-musicians working on the tour (e.g. managers, etc). My advisor for this project would be Tristan Angieri because they have knowledge of both computer science and the music world. I aim to address the issue of unorganized, inefficient information collection, storage, and access in regards to venues on musical tours. Especially for a working musician who must also plan the musical aspects of the tour, coordinating with all parties involved can be overwhelming. I aim to create a system that will allow the user to streamline the information needed for individual tours/venues, gather information in an efficient way, store this information, and supply the information in an accessible way. 

### Rationale
I plan to use Google Apps Scripts to code my IA so that I can easily integrate other Google apps into the program (e.g. Google Sheets, Google Calendar, and Google Forms). I will use these pre-existing programs (the document forms) to essentially serve as the user interface; the user will not be interacting directly with the code, but instead with the Google programs that the code is animating. I chose this approach because Google Apps Script is easy to blend into pre-existing use of Googleâ€™s programs and allow the user to have pre-existing familiarity with the UI instead of learning an entirely new system. 

## Interview

### Rene Hart: Musician

#### What would you like to gain from this program?

#### As a working musician, what are some issues that you come across when communicating with venues/scheduling a tour?

#### Describe issues that you have with programs you currently use to organize this data.

#### How would you like to interact with/access this program? (e.g. pre-show, on the road, post-tour)
