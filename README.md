# Peer Tutoring App

## Problem Question
How can I use technology to improve the efficiency and accessibility of the BFS US Peer Tutoring Program?

### Project Description
The students who use the BFS US Peer Tutoring Program are my clients. There are several aspects of the program that could be more efficient or accessible that I plan to remedy with this app made specifically for this program. Some of the issues I aim to fix include scheduling difficulties, confusion about how/where to apply, finding students for smaller jobs, and updates about sessions. To improve these conditions, I'm designing a web app featuring scheduling, notifications, messaging, applications, and position openings. 

### Project Timeline

#### Sep-Oct    (month 0-1)
* plan out each aspect w/o code language
* learn about apps
* pseudocode/plan out aspects in code language

#### Oct-Nov    (month 1-2)
* code account system
* code schedule
* code applications

#### Nov-Dec    (month 2-1)
* code position openings
* code messaging
* code notifications

#### Dec-Jan    (month 3-4)
* polish code aspects
* style/graphic elements

#### Jan-Feb    (month 4-5)
* test w/ students
* fix code
* fix graphic elements

#### Feb-March  (month 5-6)
* continue to test w/ students
* fix code
* be happy :)

## Criterion A

### Scenario
My clients are the participants in and leaders of Brooklyn Friends School’s Upper School Peer Tutoring Program. As one of the co-leaders, I am very invested in this program and any ways to enhance it and implement it more effectively within my school community. To represent the larger client base, I’ve selected four individuals to interview and consult as representatives: the two co-leaders, including myself, a tutor, and a tutee. Common threads throughout my conversations with client representatives in regards to what they would like to see in the app included effective communication, accessible applications and updates, and easy scheduling. My adviser is Tristan Angieri, my Computer Science teacher, because I feel that I can rely on them for structural advice as well as coding advice in terms of what will make this program the most effective. To aid my clients, I aim to create an app that has features that assist the leaders, tutors, and tutees with ease of access, communication, and information, so that I can best support the tutoring program and more effectively integrate it into the BFS community. In this app, I will provide scheduling abilities so that students can schedule sessions and so that there will be a record for the leaders of each meeting. To address communication, there will be the ability to reach out directly to other participants, as well as the leaders. Additionally, this app will be easy to use, thereby decreasing confusion around the program and allowing students to reach out for help when the reaching out step might be the hardest. 

### Rationale
I plan to code the web app in javascript/css/html because I am familiar with the language and it lends itself to creating easily customizable web apps. Furthermore, I can easily separate the visuals in css and the basic structure in html and the functionality in javascript, which will help me split up the work for this project because this is the first time I'm tackling a project of this scale. For a framework, I will use node.js. According to my research, it is not only the go-to framework used by many programmers, but it also is one of the most effective frameworks. Because I plan to incorporate many features into this web app, using node.js will allow me to focus more on the relationships between each aspect instead of the basic outline. For a host, I plan to use Heroku firstly because it's free, secondly because it's scaleable, so theoretically if this web app were to be used by more people or expanded to be adapted into other programs, it could easily do so. 

## Interview

### Lizzy Guaba: Co-Leader

#### What would be beneficial about an app?
* descriptions of services, ex writing center
* easy application

* scheduling

#### What aspects of the program could/should an app support?
* communication, between leaders and participants & between students participating
* advertisement

#### As a co-leader, what would you like to see in this app?
* easy designation of tutors/tutees
* notifications

#### Do you have concerns?
* scheduling might be difficult/complicated (interface wise)

### Jasmyne Hart: Co-Leader (self)

#### What would be beneficial about an app?
* easy communication/access for the digital generation
* centralized place for any updates, applications, etc
* automate/enhance tasks that leaders do manually

#### What aspects of the program could/should an app support?
* scheduling
* notifications
* open positions
* communication between tutors/tutees

#### As a co-leader, what would you like to see in this app?
* intuitive interface
* easy to use for participants
* straightforward to manage from a leader's perspective

#### Do you have concerns?
* overestimating the amount of work that's possible

* not actually helpful for the intended audience

### Cyrah Joseph: Tutor

#### What would be beneficial about an app?
* reminders
* alerts
* communicate info, tutor to tutee
* who created the peer tutoring program
* awareness (a lot of ppl hate email)

#### What aspects of the program could/should an app support?
* schedule
* availabe tutors (tutee can choose)
* tips
* bios/users esp of tutors

#### As a tutor, what would you like to see in this app?
